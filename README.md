## [Demo] Geolocation-based search with Laravel Scout and Algolia


This project is showing how to use geolocation-based search (geo-search) with Laravel Scout and Algolia.
You cab find the full tutorial on [scotch.io](TO UPDATE).

It uses _macros_ to extend Laravel Scout ([see this commit](https://github.com/julienbourdeau/geo-search-laravel-scout-demo/commit/a8a26206077f69b493909fb91b0be67d37ad1f24)).

### Laravel Scout extension

I also started a package to bundle useful [Algolia-specific macros](https://github.com/algolia/laravel-scout-algolia-macros).
